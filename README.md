# PDDL-Grounder
A tool that, given as input the domain.pddl and problem.pddl files, generates the grounded translation of the problem

## Requirements
* Python version: 3.7 or higher
* [Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/) 
* [Antlr4 Python3 runtime target](https://www.antlr.org/download.html)

##Code Overview
* [pddl.g4](pddl.g4) - The grammar file. It currently supports a simplified version of PDDL+.( An example: [domain.pddl](/domain.pddl) [problem-1.pddl](problem-1.pddl) )
* [antlr4-output] - The directory made by Antlr4 using the grammar pddl.g4 with the command: 
```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=python3 pddl.g4 -o antlr4_directory
```
* [Domain_parser.py](Domain_parser.py) - It contains the functions needed to traverse the parse-tree generated by the antlr4 parser and to represent the tree in JSON format. For example [domain.json](domain.json) and [problem.json](problem.json)
